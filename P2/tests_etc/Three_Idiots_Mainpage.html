<p style="color:rgb(54, 1, 54);"> To be honestly,<br>Althouhg the film spends much of its time wallowing in the throes of sometimes vulgar screwball comedy, 
there is also some narrative width to the plot, and this may expand the filmâ€™s appeal for some viewers.
In particular, there is a thoughtful thematic element concerning how best to educate students and
the current deficiencies of educational systems in general.  These educational system deficiencies,
I should add, are not only present in India, but are characteristic of educational systems at all levels
all over the world. </p>
