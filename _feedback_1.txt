FIRST IMPRESSION
%	Well file managment is not what you are good at.
%    I will really need you to fix that, please ask aTA for help on referencing between files and between folders.
%    It will otherwise become a problem for assignment 3. Maybe even 2 already.
    So your Responsive design is not great. I do remmeber us trying to fix the image problem.
    But this did not get better. hmmm

MUST HAVES
	(-)	HTML	 frequent use of Div. There are other tags you can use, 			and you can avoid using a tag altogether if you structure your css well.
	(-)	CSS	RD      bad RD. Mixed use of Pixel and percentager leading to a bad time.
                    percentage usage should be your default. Pixel usage should be for extremes or media queries
    (+) CSS RD      We failed you as TA's. Making it a point to give better direction. My input would not have leadyou towards a better grad my apologies for this.
                    I avoided trying to tell you to redo your CSS, and i should not have.
    (-) HTML        div class="containerwrapper"> this is the perfect momemnt for <Article>
                    <div class="textcontainer"> and this is a perfect moment for <section>
    (-) CSS         only usage of classes. This probably cost you a lot of time. But referencing tage may have been faster.
                    Example A :.all-sections why not use the HTML tag <sections> and refer to all of them. not with a class name.
    (-) CSS         No attempt at BEM naming convention.
    (-) a           Due to lack of <p>, <Section> and <Article>. More <p> and less <br>
    (-) HTML        not the correct use of a table.
MAINTAIN GOOD CODING STYLE
    Well...... all the files in one are hmmmmm.
    For the rest it is well done.

COMMENTS
    There is a lot to learn. There is so much knowledge in this course that it is hard.
    If you follow the lectures, a lot of these minor mistake can be avoided.
    And oftern the extra hour of the lecture can save you time in coding, because you learnfaster ways to do things.

    All in all for a first website builtthrough CSS and HTML well done.
    Please keep asking questions in tutor rooms, we can also give quick feed back that coul save you effort EARLY in your project.  
    refactoring is always costly.
